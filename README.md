# Project: Settlers of Catan in AR

## Description

The game fields are 3D printed and provided with a marker. In total, the game field consists of 19 markers and three additonal build markers to place roads, houses and cities. The playing field contains five resources: lumber, wool, brick, wheat and ore and a desert. All resources, except the desert, which is always placed in the center, are distributed randomly on the markers. Players can build roads, houses and cities. The roads, houses and cities are placed on the edges between the game field markers when a player places the corresponding build marker in the camera view.  Players play in turns and receive resources when the dice are rolled. Once a player can't or does not want to build anything else, they have to point the 'next player' marker into the camera and the game will move on to the next player. Winner of the game is the player who first reaches 10 victory points, where victory points are awarded for building houses, cities and for the longest road.
