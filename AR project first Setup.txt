First AR Setup:
one extern camera that captures the physical game
one window on a laptop that lays the virtual game on top

one marker tracker that tracks resource-markers and lays random numbers on top (number-grid)
all resource-markers are world-reference markers that can determine the camera position
game logic with opengl, which calculates a settlement-grid and a street-grid where the assets can be placed
